4.1 3D Best Fit Algorithm 
Decide on a packing direction. Each bin has three
directions in which to pack, a width (or x) direction, a 
height (or y) direction, a depth (or z) direction. Pack one
bin at a time. 
We first choose a pivot point. The pivot is an (x, y, z) 
coordinate which represents a point in a particular 3D bin 
at which an attempt to pack an item will be made. The 
back lower left corner of the item will be placed at the 
pivot. If the item cannot be packed at the pivot position
then it is rotated until it can be packed at the pivot point
or until we have tried all 6 possible rotation types. If after 
rotating it, the item still cannot be packed at the pivot
point, then we move on to packing another item and add 
the unpacked item to a list of items that will be packed 
after an attempt to pack the remaining items is made. The 
first pivot in an empty bin is always (0,0,0).
